# codewars_solutions
(deprecated and old code)

This is my solutions to codewars.com problems I solved as practice back when I was only starting with python. It was never meaned to be shared thus there are some issues such as absence of problem descriptions, lack of commentaries and general naïvité when it comes to algorithms of choice. I don't think fixing it will be productive and I'd rather focus on coding and learning new things. 
Still there are some neat solutions and code is clean and understandable even without commentaries.
I don't think it may be valuable to anyone other than me though. So peruse on your own risk.
